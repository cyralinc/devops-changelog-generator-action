# Changelog Generator Action

Cyral automated change log generator tool published in GitHub Marketplace.

## Usage
Such action depends on a docker login to Google Cloud Registry.
So, make sure your login credentials have permissions to access `gcr.io/cyral-dev`.

A `CHANGELOG.md` file will be generated after execute the generator.
